# SDLC Stage 8: Disposal

This document outlines the procedures for securely decommissioning the PixelForge Nexus application and its associated data at the end of its useful life. Proper disposal is critical to prevent data leakage and ensure compliance with privacy principles.

## 8.1 Data Sanitization

Before decommissioning the system, all sensitive data must be securely and permanently erased.

- **User Data**: All user information stored in the mock database (`users.json`) will be deleted. In a real system with a live database, this would involve running `DELETE` queries on the user tables.
- **Project Data**: All project and document data, which is stored in the browser's `localStorage` for this prototype, will be cleared. In a real system, this would involve deleting the corresponding records from the projects/documents tables in the database and removing the files from cloud storage.
- **Erasure Method**: For this prototype, file deletion is sufficient. In a production environment handling sensitive data, more robust data erasure techniques would be used, suchas cryptographic erasure (deleting the encryption keys) to render the data unreadable.

## 8.2 System Decommissioning

Once the data has been sanitized, the application itself can be decommissioned.

- **Application Shutdown**: The running instances of the application on the hosting provider (e.g., Firebase App Hosting, Vercel) will be shut down and deleted.
- **DNS Removal**: The DNS records pointing to the application's domain will be removed.
- **Source Code Archiving**: The source code repository will be archived for compliance and record-keeping but will be marked as "inactive" and "unsupported".

## 8.3 Archiving and Documentation

- **Critical Records**: A final copy of the user data (for legal or compliance reasons, if necessary) and the application's documentation (including all SDLC files) will be securely archived.
- **Archive Storage**: The archive will be stored in a secure, access-controlled location (e.g., an encrypted cloud storage bucket with restricted permissions).
- **Retention Policy**: A data retention policy will define how long the archive must be kept before it can also be securely deleted.

## 8.4 Asset Disposal

This refers to the physical or virtual hardware the application ran on.

- **Cloud Environment**: Since this application is designed for the cloud, there are no physical assets to dispose of. The virtual assets (server instances, storage buckets) will be deleted through the cloud provider's console.
- **Provider Guarantees**: The cloud provider's terms of service will be reviewed to ensure they guarantee the secure wiping of data from their physical hardware after a virtual resource is deleted.

## 8.5 Revocation of Access

- **User Accounts**: As part of data sanitization, all user accounts are removed.
- **Administrator and API Credentials**: All access credentials to the hosting platform, database, and any integrated third-party services will be revoked and deleted. This is a critical step to prevent orphaned accounts from being exploited in the future.
