# SDLC Stage 6: Release and Deployment

This document outlines the strategy for releasing and deploying the PixelForge Nexus application into a production environment, including the final sign-off process.

## 6.1 Release Management

All production releases will follow a structured and controlled process to ensure stability and security.

- **Versioning**: The project will use semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`) to track releases. Version numbers will be updated in the `package.json` file for each new release.
- **Change Control**: No code will be deployed to production without first going through the entire SDLC process (Design, Development, Testing). All changes must be approved by the project lead.
- **Release Candidates**: Before a final release, a "Release Candidate" (RC) build will be deployed to a staging environment. This RC will be identical to the final production build and will undergo final UAT and regression testing.

## 6.2 Deployment Strategy

The application is designed to be deployed on a modern cloud platform that supports Node.js applications, such as Firebase App Hosting, Vercel, or AWS.

### Deployment Process
1.  **Build**: The Next.js application is compiled into an optimized production build using the `npm run build` command. This process transpiles TypeScript, bundles JavaScript, and optimizes assets.
2.  **Environment Configuration**: Production-specific environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys) will be securely loaded into the production environment. These secrets will **never** be stored in the source code repository.
3.  **Deployment**: The built application is deployed to the hosting provider. Most modern providers (like Vercel or Firebase) offer a seamless deployment experience integrated with Git, allowing for automated deployments on every push to the `main` branch.
4.  **Health Checks**: After deployment, automated health checks will be run against the production URL to ensure the application is online and responding correctly.

## 6.3 Certification and Accreditation (C&A)

Before the application can be authorized for production use, it must undergo a formal Certification and Accreditation process. This is the final gate in the release cycle.

-   **Certification**: This is the comprehensive technical evaluation of the system and its security controls.
    -   **Process**: All artifacts from the SDLC, including the requirements (`2_requirements.md`), design documents (`3_architecture_and_design.md`), and especially the full results of the testing stage (`5_testing.md`), are compiled.
    -   **Outcome**: A formal report is produced that certifies the system has been tested against the specified security requirements and documents any remaining risks. This process confirms that we have built the system *correctly*.

-   **Accreditation**: This is the official management decision to authorize the system for operation in a production environment.
    -   **Process**: A designated authority (e.g., a system owner or management board) reviews the certification report, the risk analysis, and the overall business need for the application.
    -   **Outcome**: If the benefits are deemed to outweigh the residual risks, the system is granted "Accreditation," or formal approval to go live. This confirms that we have built the *right* system for the business's needs.

## 6.4 Protection Against Threats

### Internal Threats
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Access to the production environment (hosting dashboard, database) will be strictly limited. Only authorized administrators will have deployment privileges. Developers will not have direct access to the production environment.
- **Change Management**: A formal change management process ensures that all code deployed to production has been reviewed and tested, reducing the risk of accidental errors or malicious code being introduced by an insider.

### External Threats
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: In a real production scenario, a WAF would be deployed in front of the application to provide an additional layer of security against common web attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and malicious bots.
- **DDoS Protection**: The chosen cloud hosting provider should offer built-in protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- **Secure Configuration**: The production server will be configured securely, with unnecessary ports closed and services hardened according to industry best practices.
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: The hosting environment will be configured to enforce HTTPS on all connections, ensuring all data is encrypted in transit.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated tools (like `npm audit` or integrated platform features) will be used to continuously scan for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies and trigger alerts when patches are needed.
