# OWASP Top 10 2021 - Security Analysis of PixelForge Nexus

This document provides a detailed analysis of the PixelForge Nexus application against the OWASP Top 10 2021 security risks. It outlines how the application's design and implementation proactively mitigate these common vulnerabilities.

### A01:2021 – Broken Access Control

**Description**: Failures related to enforcing policies that prevent users from acting outside of their intended permissions.

**Mitigation**: This is the most critical security principle in PixelForge Nexus, addressed through a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.

1.  **Role-Based Permissions**: The application defines three distinct roles (`admin`, `project-lead`, `developer`) in `src/lib/auth.ts`, each with a specific set of privileges.
2.  **Server-Side Authorization**: Every sensitive action is authorized on the mock server. For example, the `updateUserRole` function explicitly prevents changing the role of an admin.
    ```typescript
    // File: src/lib/auth.ts
    export const updateUserRole = async (
      username: string,
      newRole: 'project-lead' | 'developer'
    ): Promise<{ success: boolean; message: string }> => {
      // ...
      // [SECURITY] Access Control (OWASP A01)
      // Prevent changing the role of the admin user.
      if (user.role === 'admin') return { success: false, message: 'Cannot change the role of an admin user.' };

      user.role = newRole;
      await writeUsersToFile(users);
      return { success: true, message: 'User role updated successfully.' };
    };
    ```
3.  **Client-Side UI Enforcement**: The UI dynamically renders components based on user roles, preventing users from even seeing actions they are not permitted to perform. The `canManageDocs` flag in `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` is a perfect example.
    ```tsx
    // File: src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
    const canManageDocs = user?.role === 'admin' || (user?.role === 'project-lead' && user.username === project.lead);
    
    // ... later in the JSX ...
    {canManageDocs && (
        <Button>Delete Document</Button>
    )}
    ```

### A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures

**Description**: Failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof), which often lead to exposure of sensitive data.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Secure Transit (Assumed)**: In a production environment, all communication would be enforced over HTTPS (via hosting configuration), protecting data like passwords and session tokens from being intercepted.
2.  **Secure Password Storage (Mocked)**: We simulate the use of strong, salted password hashing. The `passwordHash` field in `src/lib/auth.ts` uses a `_hashed` suffix to represent a hash that would be generated by an algorithm like **Argon2** or **bcrypt**.
    ```typescript
    // File: src/lib/auth.ts
    // In a real app, this would be: `await bcrypt.compare(password, hash)`
    const verifyPassword = async (password: string, hash: string): Promise<boolean> => {
        return `${password}_hashed` === hash;
    }
    ```
3.  **No Sensitive Data Exposure**: The authentication flow in `src/lib/auth.ts` is designed to never send sensitive information (like the `passwordHash` or `loginAttempts`) to the client.

### A03:2021 – Injection

**Description**: Flaws that allow attackers to inject hostile data into an application, most commonly SQL injection, but also Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Strict Server-Side Input Validation**: We use **Zod** schemas with strict "allow-list" regular expressions on the mock backend. This is the primary defense against injection attacks, as it ensures that no malicious characters can be processed.
    ```typescript
    // File: src/lib/auth.ts
    const LoginCredentialsSchema = z.object({
      username: z.string().regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$/), // Allows only specific, safe characters.
      password: z.string().min(8),
    });

    // The function validates the input before proceeding.
    export const checkCredentials = async (username: string, pass: string): Promise<AuthResponse> => {
      const validation = LoginCredentialsSchema.safeParse({ username, password: pass });
      if (!validation.success) {
        // Rejects any input that doesn't match the regex.
        return { status: 'invalid', message: 'Invalid username or password.' };
      }
      // ... continue processing
    }
    ```
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**: The application is built with **React** and **Next.js**, which automatically escape data rendered in JSX, providing strong default protection against XSS. We do not use dangerous methods like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user-provided content.

### A04:2021 – Insecure Design

**Description**: A category that focuses on risks related to design and architectural flaws, which are not necessarily implementation bugs.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Threat Modeling**: Our SDLC documentation (`docs/sdlc/3_architecture_and_design.md`) includes a threat modeling exercise that identifies potential threats (Spoofing, Tampering, etc.) and designs mitigations for them.
2.  **Secure Defaults**: The application is designed to be secure by default. For example, user self-registration is disabled (`src/components/signup-form.tsx`), and new accounts can only be provisioned by an administrator. This prevents unauthorized account creation.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: The entire RBAC system is a testament to this principle, ensuring users have the minimum access necessary.

### A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

**Description**: Missing or insecure configurations in the application stack, frameworks, or cloud services.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Framework Security**: By using a modern, opinionated framework like Next.js, we inherit many secure defaults and avoid common misconfigurations found in manually configured servers.
2.  **Error Handling**: The application is configured to not leak sensitive information in error messages. The `checkCredentials` function returns generic error messages to the user, while detailed errors would be logged server-side (simulated by `console.error` in our case).

---

### A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures

**Description**: Failures in user identity management, credential management, and session management.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Brute-Force Protection**: The system implements an account lockout mechanism. As defined in `src/lib/auth.ts`, an account is locked after `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` (3) consecutive failed logins.
2.  **User Enumeration Prevention**: The login flow (`checkCredentials` in `src/lib/auth.ts`) returns the exact same generic error message for both an invalid username and an incorrect password. This prevents an attacker from using the login page to discover valid usernames.
3.  **NIST-Aligned Password Policies**: We enforce a minimum password length of 8 characters and implement password expiration, aligning with modern NIST guidelines.
4.  **Session Management (Mocked)**: For this demo, session management is handled via `localStorage` in `src/context/auth-context.tsx`. The file contains explicit comments warning that in a production environment, this should be replaced with **secure, HttpOnly cookies** to prevent session hijacking via XSS.
