# OWASP Top 10 2021 - Security Analysis of PixelForge Nexus

This document provides a detailed analysis of the PixelForge Nexus application against the OWASP Top 10 2021 security risks. It outlines how the application's design and implementation proactively mitigate these common vulnerabilities.

### A01:2021 – Broken Access Control

**Description**: Failures related to enforcing policies that prevent users from acting outside of their intended permissions.

**Mitigation**: This is the most critical security principle in PixelForge Nexus, addressed through a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.

1.  **Role-Based Permissions**: The application defines three distinct roles (`admin`, `project-lead`, `developer`) in `src/lib/auth.ts`, each with a specific set of privileges.
2.  **Server-Side Authorization**: Every sensitive action is authorized on the mock server. For example, the `updateUserRole` function explicitly prevents changing the role of an admin. This is the authoritative enforcement layer.
3.  **Client-Side UI Enforcement**: The UI dynamically renders components based on user roles, preventing users from even seeing actions they are not permitted to perform (e.g., the "Delete Document" button is hidden from Developers). This provides a good user experience but is not relied on for security.
4.  **Route Protection**: Client-side logic in `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` and admin-only pages redirects users who try to access URLs they are not authorized to view.

### A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures

**Description**: Failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof), which often lead to exposure of sensitive data.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Secure Transit (HTTPS)**: In a production environment, all communication would be enforced over HTTPS (via hosting provider configuration), protecting data like passwords, session tokens, and MFA secrets from being intercepted during transmission.
2.  **Password Storage (Hashing)**: We simulate the use of strong, salted password hashing. The `passwordHash` field in `src/lib/auth.ts` uses a `_hashed` suffix to represent a hash that would be generated by a strong, slow algorithm like **Argon2** or **bcrypt**, as recommended by NIST. This makes it computationally infeasible to reverse the hash and discover the original password.
3.  **Secure MFA Secret Storage**: The TOTP secret used for Multi-Factor Authentication is highly sensitive. In our mock backend (`users.json`), it is stored in plaintext for demonstration. The `src/lib/mfa.ts` file explicitly documents that in a real system, this secret **must be encrypted at rest** in the database.
4.  **No Sensitive Data Exposure to Client**: The authentication flow in `src/lib/auth.ts` is designed to never send sensitive information (like the `passwordHash` or `mfaSecret`) to the client.

### A03:2021 – Injection

**Description**: Flaws that allow attackers to inject hostile data into an application, most commonly SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Mitigation**:
1.  **SQL Injection Prevention**: Although we don't use a SQL database, we defend against the *principle* of injection attacks. We use **Zod** schemas with strict "allow-list" regular expressions on the mock backend (`/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$/` for usernames). This is the primary defense, as it ensures that no malicious characters (`'`, `--`, `;`) can be processed.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**: The application is built with **React** and **Next.js**, which automatically escape data rendered in JSX. This provides strong, built-in protection against reflected and stored XSS because any user-provided string containing `<script>` tags will be rendered as harmless text, not executed as code.

### A04:2021 – Insecure Design

**Description**: A category that focuses on risks related to design and architectural flaws, which are not necessarily implementation bugs.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Threat Modeling**: Our SDLC documentation (`docs/sdlc/3_architecture_and_design.md`) includes a threat modeling exercise (STRIDE) that identifies potential threats and designs mitigations for them from the start.
2.  **Secure Defaults**: The application is designed to be secure by default. For example, user self-registration is disabled, new accounts can only be provisioned by an administrator, and new users are required to change their default password on first login.
3.  **Separation of Concerns**: Critical logic is separated into distinct modules. For instance, all core MFA logic is encapsulated in `src/lib/mfa.ts`, and authentication logic is in `src/lib/auth.ts`, making them easier to audit and secure.

---

### A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

**Description**: Missing or insecure configurations in the application stack, frameworks, or cloud services.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Framework Security**: By using a modern, opinionated framework like Next.js, we inherit many secure defaults and avoid common misconfigurations found in manually configured servers.
2.  **Error Handling**: The application is configured to not leak sensitive information in error messages. The `checkCredentials` function returns generic error messages to the user ("Invalid username or password"), while detailed errors are logged server-side via our centralized `logger.ts` service.
3.  **Environment Separation**: Sensitive configuration like API keys are managed in a `.env.local` file, which is kept out of version control, securely separating configuration from code.

---

### A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components

**Description**: Using components, libraries, or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Dependency Management**: We use `npm` to manage our dependencies, which are explicitly versioned in `package.json`.
2.  **Regular Audits (Simulated)**: In a real development workflow, we would run `npm audit` or use services like GitHub's Dependabot to regularly scan for known vulnerabilities in our dependencies and update them promptly.
3.  **Trusted Sources**: All libraries used (e.g., Next.js, React, ShadCN, Zod, otplib) are well-maintained, popular open-source projects with active communities, which reduces the risk of using abandoned or insecure code.

### A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures

**Description**: Failures in user identity management, credential management, and session management.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Brute-Force Protection**: The system implements an account lockout mechanism. As defined in `src/lib/auth.ts`, an account is locked after `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` (3) consecutive failed logins.
2.  **Multi-Factor Authentication**: The application implements optional TOTP-based MFA, providing a strong second factor of authentication against credential theft.
3.  **User Enumeration Prevention**: The login flow (`checkCredentials` in `src/lib/auth.ts`) returns the exact same generic error message for both an invalid username and an incorrect password.
4.  **Session Management**: For this demo, session management is handled via `localStorage` in `src/context/auth-context.tsx`. The file contains explicit comments warning that in a production environment, this should be replaced with **secure, HttpOnly cookies**. HttpOnly cookies are inaccessible to client-side JavaScript, which is the primary mitigation against session hijacking via XSS attacks.

### A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures

**Description**: Failures related to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. This includes insecure deserialization and software updates without integrity checks.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Data Validation**: The mock "database" (`users.json`) is read and written by `src/lib/auth.ts`. All data written to this file comes from strongly-typed, validated sources using Zod schemas. This prevents malformed or arbitrary objects from being written, mitigating risks similar to insecure deserialization.
2.  **Secure Dependencies**: We do not use any libraries that perform complex or unsafe object deserialization on untrusted data.
3.  **Build and Deployment Pipeline (Simulated)**: In a real-world CI/CD pipeline, software updates would be built from a trusted source (our Git repository) on a secure build server, and dependencies would be scanned, preventing un-audited code from being deployed.

### A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

**Description**: Insufficient logging, monitoring, or response to security incidents.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **Centralized Logging**: The application uses a dedicated logging service at `src/lib/logger.ts`. This service standardizes log formats and makes it easy to route logs to a monitoring service in the future.
2.  **Action Logging**: The application's backend logic (`src/lib/auth.ts`) uses the logger service for significant security-relevant events like user creation, MFA setup, password updates, failed logins, and account lockouts.
3.  **Generic User-Facing Errors**: While detailed logs are generated "server-side", the client receives only generic, non-informative error messages, preventing attackers from gaining insights from error details.

---

### A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Description**: Flaws that allow an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing.

**Mitigation**:
1.  **No Server-to-Server Requests**: The application's current functionality does not require the server to make requests to external URLs based on user input. For example, when documents are uploaded, their content is read directly and stored as a Data URI; the server does not fetch a URL provided by the user.
2.  **Strictly Controlled Egress (Architectural)**: In a production environment, network policies and firewall rules would be configured to deny all outbound traffic from the server by default, explicitly allowing only necessary connections to known, trusted services (e.g., Google Cloud services, database endpoints). This architectural control provides a strong defense against SSRF even if such functionality were added later.
